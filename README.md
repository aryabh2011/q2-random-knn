# q2-random-knn

Quarter 2 Project for TJHSST ML, completed by Arya Bharath and James Wright. In this project, we employ the KNN model instead of Decision Trees for Random Forest in order to perform Ensemble Learning with KNN, as we felt that KNN might be able to better capture nonlinear trends in the data - particularly when data from the same class tend to cluster in space.

In this repository, our two folders are **deliverables** and **models**.
**Deliverables** showcases our Q2 Project Final Report as well as our Presentation.
**Models** contains the Python scripts that we coded for our project.
